# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome!

## Guidelines

* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Add section if needed.
* Add your links: `* [project-name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a dot.`
* Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
* Don't mention `Polymer` in the description as it's implied.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
* Send a Pull Request.

### Note about elements listing
Since it's impossible to include and mantain the elements list if anyone submit his own, only the official elements are listed. I suggest you to submit your Polymer elements to one of the directory mentioned in the list.

Thanks!
